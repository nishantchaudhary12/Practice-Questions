Your program should declare all of the variables listed above using the given names and
declare additional variables to solve the following problem:
For each line of the input file do the following,
calculate how many hours and minutes that person worked,
calculate how much pay they made for that day, (hours worked * hourlyPay), and
print in order [You’ll probably want to use formatted printing with printf.]
their four times in military time format (i.e. the way they were read in),
the number of hours worked,
the hourly pay rate,
the pay for the day,
the person’s first name, and
the person’s last name
Keep a running sum of the total amount to be paid to all employees listed in the file.
Find the max hours worked and the min hours worked that day.

After all the data in the file is read, find
the average pay for the day and
the average number of hours worked.
Print out
the total count of employees,
the total amount to be paid to all employees,
the two averages,
the max hours worked and
the min hours worked.
An example is below but yours can be different.
